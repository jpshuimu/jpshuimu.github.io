We find that truly bottom-up diffusion is quite rare in Hu's or Xi's administration. Under Xi, however, top-down surpassed hybrid as the dominant mode of diffusion.","tags":[],"title":"From Hu to Xi: A Corpus-Based Approach to Understanding Policy Diffusion in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leo Y.
